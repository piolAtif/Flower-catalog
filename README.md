# Flower-catalog
  Exploring 'http' by building my own server that serves a flower catalog

## Requirements:
* node	
* npm

## How to use it

```shell
npm init
npm start
```

npm init will install all dependencies.

npm start will start the server

Once the server has started, you may visit http://localhost:8080 on your 
browser

## Todo

Need to add tests. Now that the controller is refactored, I can add mocking.
